Super Duper Macro
version 1.2
by hypehuman

Open the interface by typing /sdm

This addon allows you to create macros beyond the 255-character limit, and even beyond the 1023-character macrotext limit.  However, no individual line in a macro may be more than about 1000 characters.  The number of lines is virtually unlimited.

This mod allows you to make two types of macros: button macros ("b"), which modify regular macro, allowing you to place it on your action bar, and floating macros ("f"), which do not have buttons, are accessed by /click, and are limitless in number.  To set an icon for a button macro, use the regular macro interface (/macro).

I haven't yet made the interface as pretty as I'd like (I'm just learning xml), and I haven't put in all the error handling features that I want to.  Some of them are:

¥ There is no warning if you create two macros with the same name, so please don't do that.  If you make one with the same name as an existing macro, it will overwrite it.  If you attempt to make more with the same name, it will act erratically.
¥ Gray out certain buttons when appropriate
¥ Clickable menu of macros
¥ Add interface for putting in long scripts (basically just strings to be called with RunScript())

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to be updating the interface and adding features.  If anyone has an idea, please let me know on wowinterface.com, or add it yourself and upload it :)  I haven't gotten a lot of feedback on this addon, but I know people have been using it.  So please let me know what you like about it and what you don't!

Special thanks to the creators of Behaviors, from which I shamelessly copied many UI elements.
