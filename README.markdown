Open the interface by typing `/sdm`

This addon allows you to create macros beyond the 255-character limit, and even beyond the 1023-character macrotext limit.  However, no individual line in a macro may be more than 1023 characters long (you will get a warning).  The number of lines is unlimited.  Super Duper Macro also allows you to share macros with your friends in-game.

This mod allows you to make two types of macros:
* Button macros are just like regular macros, but they can be as long as you want.  You cannot make an unlimited number of them; they share a limit with your regular macros (36 global and 18 character-specific for each character).
* Floating macros do not have buttons, and are accessed by /click.  You can make as many of these as you want.
* You can also make lua scripts of unlimited length that you can call using "/sdm run <name>" or via sdm_RunScript("name")

Suggestions and bug reports are always welcome.  You can post comments on the wowinterface.com page for this addon, or if you want to add something yourself, you can upload it in the "Optional Files" tab.

Special thanks to:
* SuperMacro, which inspired the idea for this addon.
* All the regulars on the UI & Macro forums, who have been guiding me through this process.
